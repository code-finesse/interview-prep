Backtracking is a method to solve problems by making a series of choices that we can return or backtrack to

In solving problems like this there are usually three main functions
    1. Driver function that calls our helper function where appropriate
    2. Helper function that processes the elements or checks which ones to process
    3. Main logic function that does the heavy lifting at each instance

3 KEYS of our main logic function
    1. Our Choice 
        What choice do we make at each call of the function?
        RECURSION EXPRESSES DECISION
    2. Our Constraints
        When do we stop following a certain path?
        When do we not waste time and attempt a certain option
    3. Our goal
        What's our target?
        What are we trying to find?
        BASE CASE COMES FROM OUR GOAL


the call stack "remembers" our choices and "knows" what to choose next

choose -> explore -> unchoose
