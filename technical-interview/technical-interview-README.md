# Technical Interview

## Description
There are many kinds of technical problems. The biggest part of doing a technical problem is to understand the patterns, constraints, and goals. Most problems or challenges have similarities to others. Those patterns are the things that you should be able to recognize and work from. Once you have a strong understanding of the patterns, working towards them will look very similar. The differences from one subset of problems to another are the constraints and the goals.

This readme will hopefully shed some light on the different patterns that come up and the approaches that lend themselves well to solving the problems. Below you can see the different types, and there will be links to each category.

## Prerequisite Fundamentals
List of things that the user should understand before trying to learn or implement this
* fundamental 1
* fundamental 2
* fundamental 3

## Before Getting Started
Things to have installed or set up before diving into the code 
(eg. create-react-app globally, mongoDB, python3 etc.)
* install 1
* install 2
* install 3
* maybe there are no installs and this can just be run in the browser

## Extra Things to Note
Users should keep these things in mind. Let them know things won't work unless they have done these
* In order to understand the implementation of certain things and more in depth understanding of specific problems, you can go to the [coding-challenges](https://github.com/code-finesse/coding-challenges) repository
* That is where you can find individual problems, their solutions, and some comments explaining the thought process of the code


## How To Navigate (if necessary)
Simple explanation of how to navigate the project folders (if not already explained in the project's README.md)
